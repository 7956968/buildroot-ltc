Changes to talmmu for v2 have changed the API in the following ways:

 - All TAL Memspaces are now IMG_HANDLE rather than IMG_UINT32 type.

 - Callback functions no longer return memory space in the integer variable in the callback function but in the void* variable instead.

 
 
Changes to gzip_fileio
 
- Adding const to have fopen and printf like prototypes and C++ compatibility
- changing read/write buffers to be void* to allow any buffer input/output
- changed return code of OpenFile to be either IMG_SUCCESS or IMG_ERROR_COULD_NOT_OBTAIN_RESOURCE (was sometime IMG_ERROR_FATAL when checking FILE* != NULL after fopen)
- changing the call to free to be IMG_FREE
- was applying compression string even if non-compressed file used
- changing asserts to be used only when library is not used correctly (return code otherwise)
- CMakeLists is using ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR instead of ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIRS and use ZLIB_DEFINITIONS
- some casting to gzFile were not done
