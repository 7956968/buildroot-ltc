This vcp library make immense amendment to the Alango DEMO. 
We package vcp as a library instead of app to meet the AEC demand 
in audiobox. 
There are several option control by VCP_CODEC_BYPASS and VCP_RX_ENHANCE.
VCP_CODEC_BYPASS mean the codec support the function of "bypass" which 
when enabled the codec hardware will return ADC & DAC data stream at the
same time.
VCP_RX_ENHANCE mean the RX data will be enhanced, such as noise suppression,equalizering, and Automatic gain control.
